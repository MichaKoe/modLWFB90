Description: The hydrological model LWF-Brook90 simulates water fluxes, soil moisture and drought stress. Within the FVA-BW it is increasingly used for research project and applications. 
  Using the FVA-servers' structure and building on pschmidtwalter's R-Package LWFBrook90R, this package is designed as a wrapper to provide guided assistance for spatially explicit soil water modelling.
